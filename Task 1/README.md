# 🧠 What is Generative AI?

Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that can **create new content** — such as **text, images, music, code**, or even **videos**.  
Unlike traditional AI, which only analyzes existing data, **Generative AI produces original outputs** — which is why it's called *“generative.”*

## ⚙️ How Does Generative AI Work?

1. **Learning from Data**: Trained on large datasets (e.g., books, images, audio), the AI identifies patterns in language, design, or sound.  
2. **Model Training with Algorithms**: Uses machine learning models like **Transformers** (e.g., GPT, DALL·E) to understand and replicate structures.  
3. **Output Generation**: When prompted (e.g., “draw a futuristic car”), the model creates new content — not just a copy.
